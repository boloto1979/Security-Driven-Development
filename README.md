# Security-Driven Development (SDD) Guidelines

Welcome to our repository, where we champion the integration of security into the heart of software development. Security is not an afterthought; it's an integral part of our entire development lifecycle. Below are the key practices we adhere to in our Security-Driven Development approach.

## 1. Security Requirements Analysis

Right from the start, security requirements are defined and prioritized alongside functional requirements. This includes provisions for authentication, authorization, data confidentiality, data integrity, and auditing.

## 2. Secure Design

System design undergoes rigorous security assessments, embracing principles such as least privilege, defense in depth, and separation of duties. Threat modeling is employed at this stage to identify and mitigate potential attack vectors.

## 3. Secure Coding

We adopt coding practices that prevent security vulnerabilities, including but not limited to SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), etc. Adherence to secure coding guidelines specific to our programming languages and static code analysis tools is standard practice here to pinpoint security issues.

## 4. Security Testing

Our testing suite includes a range of security-specific tests such as penetration testing, dynamic application security testing (DAST), and software composition analysis to uncover vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.

## 5. Security-Focused Code Review

In addition to standard code reviews, we conduct extra layers of review targeting security concerns specifically. This includes ensuring adherence to secure coding best practices and manually analyzing critical security junctures.

## 6. Incident Response and Security Patching

We have proactive plans in place for responding to security incidents, including quick patches and updates to address vulnerabilities discovered post-deployment.

## 7. Security Training and Awareness

We are committed to educating our developers and stakeholders on security principles and best practices to ensure security is a shared responsibility.

By adopting a Security-Driven Development model, we aim to reduce the number of vulnerabilities, increase end-user trust, and lower the costs associated with security issue remediation post-deployment. Treating security as a fundamental and ongoing component of the software development cycle enables us to build more resilient systems against cyber threats.

## Wiki

Our repository's Wiki is up and running! It's the central hub for detailed documentation on Security-Driven Development (SDD) practices. While we've populated it with key information, please note that it's still a work in progress. 

Inside the Wiki, you can find:

- A comprehensive breakdown of SDD practices
- Examples of how to apply SDD in different programming languages
- Contribution guidelines
- Security policies and procedures
- And much more!

We're continually improving and expanding the Wiki to make it a valuable resource for everyone interested in secure software development. Your contributions and suggestions are welcome; they'll help the Wiki grow and evolve. Check back often for updates and feel free to reach out if you have something to add!
